# Predicting Diabetes with Logistic Regression

## Overview

Welcome to the Predicting Diabetes with Logistic Regression repository! This project focuses on building a predictive model for diabetes using Logistic Regression. The README.md provides a concise overview of the methodology, evaluation metrics, results, and implications.

## Methods

### Data Preprocessing

Extensive data preprocessing includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### Model Construction

The predictive model uses Logistic Regression, known for simplicity and interpretability, ideal for binary classification of diabetes presence.

## Evaluation

Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used for rigorous assessment. AUC-ROC curve measures the model's discriminatory power on the testing dataset.

## Results

The report presents quantitative metrics and visual representations, emphasizing interpretability of the model.

## Discussion

Findings are discussed within the context of diabetes prediction and management, addressing limitations and suggesting areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

This research contributes insights into diabetes prediction using Logistic Regression, emphasizing early diagnosis and practical healthcare applications.
